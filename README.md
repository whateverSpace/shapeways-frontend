# shapeways

Shapeways(https://shapeways.netlify.app/) is a gesture-based music generator and art generator. It's interactive art that explores new ideas and technologies in music and user interface. Part multimedia sandbox, part installation art for the home, and part exploration of new forms of expression and interaction, it resides at the intersection of art and technology.

## Controls

Once the models have loaded, press space to start the musical accompaniment.
Press space to toggle between playing and paused music. Everything else can be controlled without touching your computer, using your webcam.

The webcam will track the locations of your wrists and nose. Shapeways divides what the camera sees into six segments in a three by two grid. This grid, and the location of your wrists and nose within it, can be used to influence the neural net generated melodies played by the two instruments, as well as several visual aspects of the experience.

- Use your wrists in different segments to trigger sounds and move shapes.
- Bring them together, spread them apart, leave them in the middle, experiment!
- The background color that slowly fills in segments is changed by the segment your nose is in.
- For best results, stand 3-6 feet from webcam in a well-lit room.
