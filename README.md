# shapeways

Shapeways is a gesture-based music generator and art generator. It's interactive art that explores new ideas and technologies in music and user interface. Part multimedia sandbox, part installation art for the home, and part exploration of new forms of expression and interaction, it resides at the intersection of art and technology.
